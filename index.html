                <h1>HTML5</h1>
                <p>HTML 5 is the fifth and current major version of the HTML
                    standard, and subsumes XHTML. It currently exists in two 
                    standardized forms: HTML 5.2 Recommendation by the World 
                    Wide Web Consortium (W3C, a broad coalition of organizations), 
                    intended primarily for Web content developers; and HTML Living Standard 
                    by WHATWG (a small consortium of four browser vendors), intended primarily 
                    for browser developers, though it also exists in an abridged Web developer version.
                    There are minor conflicts between the two groups' specifications. </br>
                <br>
                    HTML 5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008, 
                    with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.
                    Its goals are to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia 
                    and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and 
                    consistently understood by computers and devices such as Web browsers, parsers, etc., 
                    without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML 5 is 
                    intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML;[9] the HTML 
                    4 and XHTML specs were announced as superseded by HTML 5.2 on 27 March 2018</p>
